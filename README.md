# BUILD A CLIENT-SERVER CHAT APPLICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE USERS

  DESCRIPTION": 
      I HAVE USE VS-CODE BUT CHECKED MY OUTPUT IN MY WINDOWS TERMINAL THIS CODE IS FOR A SIMPLE CHAT SERVER APPLICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING. IT ALLOWS MULTIPLE USERS TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER AND SEND MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER IN REAL-TIME.THE CHAT SERVER LISTENS FOR INCOMING CONNECTIONS ON A SPECIFIED PORT NUMBER. WHEN A CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, THE SERVER CREATES A NEW INSTANCE OF THE CLIENTHANDLER CLASS TO HANDLE COMMUNICATION WITH THE CONNECTED CLIENT.
      
      THE CLIENTHANDLER CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR READING MESSAGES FROM THE CLIENT AND BROADCASTING THEM TO ALL OTHER CONNECTED CLIENTS. IT ALSO HANDLES DISCONNECTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
      THE CHAT CLIENT IS A SEPARATE PROGRAM THAT CONNECTS TO THE CHAT SERVER AND ALLOWS USERS TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES. IT USES THE JAVA SOCKET API TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER AND EXCHANGE ESSAGES.
      THE CHAT SERVER USES MULTITHREADING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE CLIENT CONNECTIONS CONCURRENTLY. EACH CLIENTHANDLER INSTANCE RUNS IN ITS OWN THREAD, ALLOWING THE SERVER TO HANDLE MULTIPLE MESSAGES SIMULTANEOUSLY.
      THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN JAVA AND USES THE JAVA SOCKET API TO ESTABLISH NETWORK CONNECTIONS. IT ALSO USES THE JAVA MULTITHREADING API TO HANDLE MULTIPLE THREADS CONCURRENTLY.
      
      HERE ARE THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE CODE:
      
      MULTIPLE CLIENT SUPPORT
      REAL-TIME MESSAGING
      MULTITHREADING
      JAVA SOCKET API
      JAVA MULTITHREADING API

        Simple Text-Based Interface: Easy-to-use and intuitive interface for users to interact.
    
    Technical Overview:
    
        Server: The server uses multithreading to handle multiple client connections, broadcasting messages to the correct recipients without delays.
        Client: Each client connects to the server to send and receive messages in real time.
        
    Technologies Used:
    
        Java: Used for developing both server and client-side applications.
        Socket Programming: Facilitates network communication between clients and the server.
        Multithreading: Ensures the server can manage multiple users concurrently without performance issues.
